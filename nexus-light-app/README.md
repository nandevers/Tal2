To run the application:
1. Navigate into the `nexus-light-app` directory: `cd nexus-light-app`
2. Install dependencies (if not already done): `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

The application should then be accessible in a web browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
